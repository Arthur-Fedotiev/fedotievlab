> Angular is set to introduce a [**new navigation error handler feature**](https://github.com/angular/angular/commit/31b94c762fc91ab6cabe08ea6812780fdcf92a64), allowing developers to create more robust applications and handle navigation errors easier with more ergonomic API🤗.

## Legacy navigation handler

Previously, in order to handle `NavigationError` developers had to manually `subscribe` to the router’s events, and then filter the results to capture only **navigation errors** 🤦‍♂️. On example of such implementation is often seen right in `AppComponent`:

```typescript
export class AppComponent implements OnInit {
  // alternatively you could use contsructor injection
  private readonly _router = inject(Router);

  // Legacy approach that will be deprecated soon
  ngOnInit() {
    this._router.events
      .pipe(filter((event) => event instanceof NavigationError))
      .subscribe(() =>
        // Handling NavigationError, e.g. redirect to error route
        this._router.navigate(["error"], { skipLocationChange: true })
      );
  }
}
```

> **You can find [full stackblitz example here](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-standalone-54ghpx?embed=1&file=src/main.ts). Trying to access Home route will produce NavigationError. GL HF!**

This manual process had following drawbacks:

- Manual process was time-consuming and prone to errors 🤔
- Required more setup ⚙️
- Cluttered component/module with unrelated logic 🔐
- Required more knowledge increasing learning curve for new developers 📈

## New Era

**The new feature**, enabled through the `withNavigationErrorHandler` function, provides developers with more ergonomic way to tackle this problems.

The idea behind it according to angular core team:

> `withErrorHandler` is a close replacement for the  
> `RouterModule.forRoot.errorHandler` / `Router.errorHandler`.  
> It provides a quick, short way for users to define a function to handle  
> `NavigationError` events. — [**angular source code**](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/48551)

**See below is a basic example how you can use it in your** `**standalone**` **application:**

```typescript
bootstrapApplication(AppComponent, {
  providers: [
    provideRouter(
      appRoutes,

      // new API goes here!!!
      withNavigationErrorHandler((err: NavigationError) =>
        inject(NavErrorHandler).handle(err)
      )
    ),
  ],
});
```

The main benefit of this new feature is that it offers developers an **easier, more ergonomic and more reliable way of handling navigation errors** 🔐.

As you can see, the new feature can leverage the `inject` function 💉, which is possible due to the fact that under the hood `withNavigationErrorHandler` utilizes the `EnvironmentInjector.runInContext` API 💻.

**Source code with _my comments_ for** `**withNavigationErrorHandler**` **looks like this:**

```typescript
export function withNavigationErrorHandler(
  fn: (error: NavigationError) => void
): NavigationErrorHandlerFeature {
  const providers = [
    {
      provide: ENVIRONMENT_INITIALIZER,
      multi: true,
      useValue: () => {
        const injector = inject(EnvironmentInjector);

        // takes responsibility to react to specific RouterEvent: NavigationError
        inject(Router).events.subscribe((e) => {
          if (e instanceof NavigationError) {
            // enables to use inject function in withNavigationErrorHandler
            injector.runInContext(() => fn(e));
          }
        });
      },
    },
  ];
  return routerFeature(
    RouterFeatureKind.NavigationErrorHandlerFeature,
    providers
  );
}
```

_From the source code above you can see that it affectively_ **_performs the same thing_** _we used to do in a past but now performing the heavylifting itself letting us to write_ **_less boilerplate code_**_, and_ **_avoid some rxjs pitfalls_** _along the way._
